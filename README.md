### Project: Currency Converter

#### About
Markdown is a special plain text formatting language that is extremely popular among developers. It is used in documents, research articles, Github README files, and other things. In this project, you will write an editor that will be able to recognize several tags, structures, and save your results to a file.

#### Learning outcomes
Practice list operations, file handling, functions, scopes, and a lot of other things. Make a handy and useful tool that uses the markdown language!

#### *Personal Notes:
As per the learning outcomes. This was a good project for practicing topics such as list operations. I learnt some new tools such as the any() and all() functions. As well as gaining a better understanding of list comprehensions, the map() and filter() functions and where they are best implemented. Engaged in some really good practise in regards to functions. Also a better understanding of global and local scopes, especially in regards to how it applies to functions. Better understanding of Lambda functions and how and when to use that. Also a good reminder and practical on string formatting.

Not sure this script will have all that much real world function. It is a bit of an obscure approach to writing Markdown, much more efficient and streamlined to write Markdown in a text editor or IDE. That said, very cool to be able to write a program that can format these things for you.
